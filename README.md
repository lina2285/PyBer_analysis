## PyBer Analysis summary
The purpose of this challenge was to provide V.Isualize with an analysis of rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. The study includes a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data for V.Isualize to compare urban, suburban, and rural city rides by fare, drivers, and dates.  The information obtained in this study will help us make recommendations to the CEO. 
## Results
To have a better understanding of what variables are more dominant, we created a data frame that includes number of rides, drivers, and fares, which is illustrated in figure 1.  The dataframe allowed us to conclude that urban cities are the higher numbers with 1,625 rides vs 125 and 625 for rural and suburban cities.  Additionally, there is a signifanctly higher number of drivers for urban cities, which might cause the avg fares to be much lower in comparison (2,405 vs 78 for rural and 490 for suburban). Another posible culprit for lowere average fares, is shorter distance rides in urban cities.

The second analysis conducted was comparing the total fare by city types through the timeline provided of January - May of 2019.  As shown on figure 2, the differences mentioned previously are even more evident in this chart.  It is easier to visualize that how the average fares differ from city types, which is probably caused by the difference in population in the three different areas discussed (urban, suburban, and rural).  We can also point out that the average fares are fairly steady through the months for Jan - May, with some slight dips and peaks throughout.

## Summary

Based on the information gather, we recommend the following:\

* Do a deeper analysis on the average fare in urban cities to understand the low averages.  As previously mentioned, some probable causes could be the large number of drivers available or the shorter distances traveled. If the number of drivers is causing the lower fares, then we recommend to come up with a way, of letting drivers know which areas are more populated with drivers.  Perhaps a heatmap that shows where most drivers are will assist other drivers to plan their day accordingly. If the issue is the distance traveled, a price restructure could be a probable solution

* We also recommend doing a deeper research on what is causing the lower rides in the rural and suburban areas. Since these areas are not as populated, there might be some incentives that might need to be considered to get more customers to use the service. 

* Lastly, based on the chart of figure 2, it is important to understand the reasons for the higher peaks and also for the dips.  If the changes are being caused by holidays or spefic events, it is crucial that planning for either more or less drivers is conducted based on the historical data.  Such planning will help the company be more profitable and efficient.
