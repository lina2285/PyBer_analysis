# PyBer_analysis
## PyBer Analysis summary
The purpose of this challenge was to provide V.Isualize with an analysis of rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. The study includes a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data for V.Isualize to compare urban, suburban, and rural city rides by fare, drivers, and dates.  The information obtained in this study will help us make recommendations to the CEO. 
## Results
To have a better understanding of what variables are more dominant, we created a data frame that includes number of rides, drivers, and fares, which is illustrated in figure 1.  The dataframe allowed us to conclude that urban cities are the higher numbers with 1,625 rides vs 125 and 625 for rural and suburban cities.  Additionally, there is a signifanctly higher number of drivers for urban cities, which causes the avg fares to be much lower in comparison (2,405 vs 78 for rural and 490 for suburban). 

### Figure 1

The second analysis conducted was comparing the total fare by city types through the timeline provided of January - May of 2019.  As shown on figure 2, the differences mentioned previously are even more evident in this chart.  It is easier to visualize that how the average fares differ from city types, which is probably caused by the difference in population in the three different areas discussed (urban, suburban, and rural).  We can also point out that the average fares are fairly steady through the months for Jan - May, with some slight dips and peaks throughout.
