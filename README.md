# PyBer_analysis
## PyBer Analysis summary
The purpose of this challenge was to provide V.Isualize with an analysis of rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. The study includes a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data for V.Isualize to compare urban, suburban, and rural city rides by fare, drivers, and dates.  The information obtained in this study will help us make recommendations to the CEO. 
## Results
To have a better understanding of what variables are more dominant, we created a data frame that includes number of rides, drivers, and fares, which is illustrated in figure 1.  The dataframe allowed us to conclude that urban cities are the higher numbers with 1,625 rides vs 125 and 625 for rural and suburban cities.  Additionally, there is a signifanctly higher number of drivers for urban cities, which might cause the avg fares to be much lower in comparison (2,405 vs 78 for rural and 490 for suburban). Another posible culprit for lowere average fares, is shorter distance rides in urban cities.

The second analysis compared the total fare by city types through the timeline of January - May of 2019.  As shown in figure 2, the differences mentioned earlier are even more evident in this chart.  It is easier to visualize how the average fares differ from city types, which is probably caused by the population difference in the three areas discussed (urban, suburban, and rural).  We can also point out that the average fares are relatively steady through the months for Jan - May, with slight dips and peaks throughout.

## Summary

Based on the information gathered, we recommend the following:

* Do a deeper analysis of the average fare in urban cities to understand the low averages. As previously mentioned, some probable causes could be many drivers available or the shorter distances traveled. If the number of drivers is causing the lower fares, we recommend coming up with a way of letting drivers know which areas are more populated with drivers. Perhaps a heatmap that shows where most drivers are will assist other drivers in planning their day accordingly. If the issue is the distance traveled, a price restructure could be a probable solution

* We also recommend doing a more profound research on what is causing the lower rides in the rural and suburban areas. Since these areas are not as populated, some incentives might need to be considered to get more customers to use the service. 

* Lastly, based on the chart in figure 2, it is essential to understand the reasons for the higher peaks and dips. If the changes are being caused by holidays or specific events, it is crucial that planning for either more or fewer drivers is conducted based on the historical data. Such planning will help the company be more profitable and efficient.
